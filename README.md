# Medical-Image-Analysis-For-Brain-Tumor-Daignosis--4th-Year-Project
Deep learning models like CNN, VGG16, Inception, and MobileNet are used in brain tumor diagnosis to automatically extract features from MRI images. CNN is great for detecting tumors, VGG16 offers high accuracy, Inception captures complex features efficiently, and MobileNet is lightweight for faster processing,These models achieve accuracy above 95%

Medical Image Analysis for Brain Tumor Diagnosis
This project focuses on developing an advanced medical image analysis system aimed at assisting in the diagnosis of brain tumors. Using state-of-the-art techniques in image processing, machine learning, and deep learning, the system analyzes brain MRI and CT scans to detect, segment, and classify tumors.

Features:
Image Registration: Aligns different modal images (MRI and CT) to a common coordinate system to enhance the accuracy of tumor detection.

Image Fusion: Combines information from multiple imaging modalities for richer and more detailed analysis.

Tumor Segmentation: Automatically isolates the tumor region from the brain scans with high precision using segmentation algorithms.

Tumor Classification: Applies convolutional neural networks (CNN) and other deep learning models to classify tumors as benign or malignant.

Data Augmentation: Utilizes techniques to expand the dataset and improve model robustness, especially useful for small medical datasets.

Objective:
To assist radiologists and medical professionals by automating the time-consuming and complex process of analyzing brain scans, enabling faster and reliable diagnosis, which is critical for effective treatment planning.

Technologies Used:
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV

Medical image processing techniques (image registration, fusion, segmentation)

Deep learning models for image classification and detection

Jupyter Notebooks for development and experimentation

Flask web framework for GUI

This project serves as a comprehensive toolset for medical image analysis targeted towards brain tumor diagnosis, suitable for academic research and practical use in clinical environments.
